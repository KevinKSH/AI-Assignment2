# Assignment 2 - DAVE3625

We have decided to use the Ruter dataset for this assignment.

Our task is to:
1. Predict passenger data for Ruter Use the same data set given to you in assignment. Data file: Ruter_data.csv
2. Make a prediction algorithm which predicts the number of passengers on a specific date for a specific bus (pick any one).
   - Input should be date and output will be number of passengers
   - Also show the prediction percentage score.
  
Regression algorithms use input data to predict a numerical value. By fitting a mathematical model into the input data, we can then find a relationship / correlation between the input data and output data of the dataset. There are many types of regression algorithms and we will experiment with the dataset and find an algorithm which fits the dataset best.

The reason we want to use regression is because we want to be able to predict the amount of passengers on a bus on a given day so that we can plan ahead and deploy even more buses if needed, for example during rush hour or on holidays. We can also use this type of algorithm to control variables that might affect the relation between input and output.

In this case, we will use the date as our input and then try to find an algorithm and train it using the dataset to then find the output which will be the number of passengers on a specific bus on a specific date.
For this assignment, we will create a simple solution that fulfills the requirements.
